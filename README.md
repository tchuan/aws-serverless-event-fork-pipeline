# aws-serverless-event-fork-pipeline
This is a serverless framework version of AWS Event Fork Pipelines (https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-event-fork-pipelines). The original pipelines are based on SAM which are only available in us region, I converted the backup pipeline to serverless framework based so it can be deployed directly from source code.
